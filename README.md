# TechnoCrown

A very simple HTML/Javascript page that downloads your Minecraft skin via your username and then applies the famous Technoblade crown to it.

I have no clue what I am doing when it comes to frontend development, so pull requests are highly appreciated

Some desirable features:
- 3D render of skin
- Work on iPhone/mobile
- Cleaner UI
